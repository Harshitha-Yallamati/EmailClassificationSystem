# Email Classification System

A Flask-based web application for classifying emails into categories: Important, Promotion, Spam, or General.

## Features

- Web interface for email classification
- Machine learning model trained on email data
- Categories: Important, Promotion, Spam, General

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Email_Classification_System
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS/Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`

4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If requirements.txt doesn't exist, install manually:
   ```bash
   pip install flask scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure the model files `logistic_model.pkl` and `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl` are present (generated by `email_training.ipynb`).

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8001`

4. Enter an email message and click "Classify" to see the predicted category.

## Training the Model

To train or retrain the model, you need the dataset `enron_dataset.csv` (not included in this repository). Obtain the dataset and place it in the project root, then run the Jupyter notebook `email_training.ipynb`. This will generate the required pickle files.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main Flask application
- `email_training.ipynb`: Notebook for data preprocessing, EDA, and model training
- `enron_dataset.csv`: Dataset used for training (not included in repository)
- `static/style.css`: CSS styles for the web interface
- `templates/index.html`: HTML template for the web page
- `logistic_model.pkl`: Trained logistic regression model
- `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`: TF-IDF vectorizer

## Dependencies

- Flask
- scikit-learn
- pandas (for training)
- numpy (for training)
- matplotlib (for training)
- seaborn (for training)
- nltk (for training)
